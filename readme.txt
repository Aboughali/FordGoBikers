1- I Choose the Ford GoBiker Data Set

2-
Explanatory story
-There is a strong relation between age and duration 
-More Males are bikers than Female, although we only have the data of one month so not a very sronmg sample
-Some Station are prefered by people than others 
- Most of the riders are subscribers but most of them dont share the Bike
-we have our highest density from ages 24 till 36

After that I focused on the Males VS Females and comparing them in all aspects possible

I choose My Explanatory data to represent as follows: 
-Females have longer duration rides than Males
-Males have older people Bking than Females
-Males and Females prefer same time to take thier rides , most of them prefer it at noon or aliitle bit after that
-We have more Female customers than males and almost the same percentage in Subscribers
-Males and Females seems to perfer same Staions 
-Not all Staions have same distributions , most busy stations are Ids 10 to 90. That goes for Start and End Stations

3-FeedBack 
I got some feed backs from a couple of my friends
-First I always forget the units in the labels and they pointed out how that is very confusion (as the duration of rides is in Sec)
-All of my plots had only the Blue color , they asked me to always gives different colrs between Males and females
-They asked me to add an intensity graph to the Age plot
